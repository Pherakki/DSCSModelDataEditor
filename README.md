# DSCSModelDataEditor
Software to edit and visualise the data and shaders of models for Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth.

Assigning Cg shaders to DSCS models is not an easy or elegant task with Blender, and so a second tool would be helpful in this regard. The current plan is to develop a Qt5 application with OpenGL.

**This program is currently under development and is not usable for any practical purposes at this current time.**
